This is a mock instagram app.The app allows users to:
- Create posts
- perform CRUD operations
- comment on other user posts
- create their own custom profile
- view other user's profiles
- Its also a chance for me to work on my html and css skills
- I will only be using function based views.I dont like using forms.py or class based views.
- I created my own custom user model and my own authentication logic.
  Thats it.
